ABOUT ME
------

I am a first-year PhD student majoring in Computer Science at Peking University. My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning.

I am currently a member in [Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies (CFCS)](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/), Peking University, supervised by [Prof. Hao Dong](https://zsdonghao.github.io/).
