ABOUT ME
------

I am a senior student majoring in Computer Science at Peking University. My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning.

I am currently a member in [Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies (CFCS)](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/), Peking University, supervised by [Prof. Hao Dong](https://zsdonghao.github.io/).  In the spring of 2019, I worked as a research intern in [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/).
