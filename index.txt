11:T64e,Non-prehensile (NP) manipulation, in which robots alter object states without forming stable grasps (for example, pushing, poking, or sliding), significantly broadens robotic manipulation capabilities when grasping is infeasible or insufficient. However, enabling a unified framework that generalizes across different tasks, objects, and environments while seamlessly integrating non-prehensile and prehensile (P) actions remains challenging: robots must determine when to invoke NP skills, select the appropriate primitive for each context, and compose P and NP strategies into robust, multi-step plans. We introduce ApaptPNP, a vision-language model (VLM)-empowered task and motion planning framework that systematically selects and combines P and NP skills to accomplish diverse manipulation objectives. Our approach leverages a VLM to interpret visual scene observations and textual task descriptions, generating a high-level plan skeleton that prescribes the sequence and coordination of P and NP actions. A digital-twin based object-centric intermediate layer predicts desired object poses, enabling proactive mental rehearsal of manipulation sequences. Finally, a control module synthesizes low-level robot commands, with continuous execution feedback enabling online task plan refinement and adaptive replanning through the VLM. We evaluate ApaptPNP across representative P&NP hybrid manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments. These results underscore the potential of hybrid P&NP manipulation as a crucial step toward general-purpose, human-level robotic manipulation capabilities.12:T60c,Assembly hinges on reliably forming connections between parts; yet most robotic approaches plan assembly sequences and part poses while treating connectors as an afterthought. Connections represent the critical "last mile" of assembly execution, while task planning may sequence operations and motion plan may position parts, the precise establishment of physical connections ultimately determines assembly success or failure. In this paper, we consider connections as first-class primitives in assembly representation, including connector types, specifications, quantities, and placement locations. Drawing inspiration from how humans learn assembly tasks through step-by-step instruction manuals, we present Manual2Skill++, a vision-language framework that automatically extracts structured connection information from assembly manuals. We encode assembly tasks as hierarchical graphs where nodes represent parts and sub-assemblies, and edges explicitly model connection relationships between components. A large-scale vision-language model parses symbolic diagrams and annotations in manuals to instantiate these graphs, leveraging the rich connection knowledge embedded in human-designed instructions. We curate a dataset containing over 20 assembly tasks with diverse connector types to validate our representation extraction approach, and evaluate the complete task understanding-to-execution pipeline across four complex assembly scenarios in simulation, spanning furniture, toys, and manufacturing components with real-world correspondence.13:T595,Humans possess an extraordinary ability to understand and execute complex manipulation tasks by interpreting abstract instruction manuals. For robots, however, this capability remains a substantial challenge, as they cannot interpret abstract instructions and translate them into executable actions. In this paper, we present Manual2Skill, a novel framework that enables robots to perform complex assembly tasks guided by high-level manual instructions. Our approach leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to extract structured information from instructional images and then uses this information to construct hierarchical assembly graphs. These graphs represent parts, subassemblies, and the relationships between them. To facilitate task execution, a pose estimation model predicts the relative 6D poses of components at each assembly step. At the same time, a motion planning module generates actionable sequences for real-world robotic implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Manual2Skill by successfully assembling several real-world IKEA furniture items. This application highlights its ability to manage long-horizon manipulation tasks with both efficiency and precision, significantly enhancing the practicality of robot learning from instruction manuals. This work marks a step forward in advancing robotic systems capable of understanding and executing complex manipulation tasks in a manner akin to human.14:T481,Imitation learning, e.g., diffusion policy, has been proven effective in various robotic manipulation tasks. However, extensive demonstrations are required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process, making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object. Experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency and manipulation proficiency of our proposed method, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen configurations with only a few demonstrations.9:["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-8 bg-background min-h-screen","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-12","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"lg:col-span-1","children":["$","$Ld",null,{"author":{"name":"Chenrui Tie","title":"PhD Student","institution":"National University of Singapore","avatar":"/bio.jpeg"},"social":{"email":"chenrui.tie@u.nus.edu","location":"Singapore","location_url":"https://maps.google.com/?q=National+University+of+Singapore","location_details":["School of Computing,","National University of Singapore"],"google_scholar":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lN8cZMMAAAAJ&","orcid":"","github":"https://github.com/crtie/","linkedin":""},"features":{"enable_likes":true,"enable_one_page_mode":false},"researchInterests":["Embodied AI","Data-Efficient Robot Learning","Generalizable Manipulation Skill","Robotic Assembly"],"keywords":["Robot Manipulation","Robot Manipulation","Non-Prehensile Manipulation","Foundation Models","Task and Motion Planning","Robot Manipulation","Robotic Assembly","Foundation Models","Robot Manipulation","Robotic Assembly","Foundation Models","Robot Manipulation","Imitation Learning","SE(3) Equivariance","Diffusion Policy","Robot Manipulation","Affordance Learning","SE(3) Equivariance","Robot Manipulation","Foundation Models","Robot Manipulation","Differentiable Physics"],"maxKeywords":5}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"lg:col-span-2 space-y-8","children":[["$","section","about",{"id":"about","className":"scroll-mt-24 space-y-8","children":[[["$","$Le","about",{"content":"I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computing, National University of Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Lin Shao](https://linsats.github.io/).\nBefore this, I received my B.S. degree from School of EECS, Peking University in 2024.
